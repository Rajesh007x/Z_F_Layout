      It was not like the legendary apple falling on Newton’s head to demonstrate the concept of gravity.
      Inventing the World Wide Web involved my growing realisation that there was a power in arranging ideas in an unconstrained, weblike way.

      When networking technology was first developed,
      a number of scientists and engineers brought their research together to create the ARPANET.<br>
      Later, other inventors’ creations paved the way for the web as we know it today.</p>
